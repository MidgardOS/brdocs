# Pre-requisites for Building the MidgardOS Core Build Root

The build process for creating a new MidgardOS core operating system build root is not a simple task. It is assumed that the person building the build root is well versed in Linux systems administration and has a solid understanding of developing software for UNIX and unix-like systems.

As such, it is recommended to only start building a MidgardOS build root if you are comfortable at a Linux Bash or Zsh shell and are willing to work through discovering and fixing issues as the build progresses.
